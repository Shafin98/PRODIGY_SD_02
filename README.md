This project consist of a web application for A Guessing Game, which I created using Electron framework. 
First download all the files, then in the terminal type "npm i" to initilize NodeModule. 
Next, type "npm i electron --save-dev" to install electron as development dependency. 
To run the app enter the command "npm run electron".
